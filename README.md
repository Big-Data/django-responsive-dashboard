django-responsive-dashboard
===========================

A generic and easy dashboard for Django applications.

This is an experiment for now. Please don't use in production. Classes and schema are still subject to change.

# Features
- jquery.shapeshift for positioning and ordering
- Per user saving of above
- Stock dashlets - Lists, RSS reader, Admin edit lists, django-report-builder, more to come.
- Add and remove dashlets (not implimented)
- Generic per user configurations on dashlets (not implimented)

## What it can't do
- No ready to use dashboard, you need need for it like contrib.admin.
- Column width is hard coded to 300px with 20px gutters. (Feel free to contribute)
